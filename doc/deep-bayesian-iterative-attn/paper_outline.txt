We designed a new deep neural network architecture, which incorporate an deep Bayesian Inference chain coupled with the normal cnn, transformer, or mlp architecture. Deep Bayesian Inference iteratively refine the data representation. Our experiments on ImageNet show that it increase the accuracy by 1% compared with ResNet50. We need to do more experiments to evaluate on more models and tasks.
